base,"You are an expert in maze item search. I'm agent $AGENT_NAME$. I'm searching in a $ROW$x$COL$ maze with other agents $OTHER_AGENT_NAME$ and an audit agent. My visibility is limited to the surrounding four positions. Given our shared goal, my position, my observation, progress, instruction from audit agent, my previous actions, available actions and helpful rules, please help me choose the best available action to achieve the goal as soon as possible.
Goal: $GOAL$
My position: $MY_POSITION$
My observation: $OBSERVATION$
Progress: $PROGRESS$
Instruction:
$INSTRUCTION$
Previous actions: $ACTION_HISTORY$
Available actions:
$AVAILABLE_ACTIONS$

Here are some helpful rules to search the maze, I must examine these rules one by one when choosing actions:
1. Always pick up items in my current positions if possible to accumulate scores.
2. Never move to positions that lead to a dead end.
3. When I can move to multiple positions that don't lead to a dead end, do not repeat previous actions and do not move to positions that have been explored.

Note: Remember to include the letter option in answer.

"You are an expert in coordinating information and instruction generating. I'm an audit agent. I'm guilding agents $ALL_AGENT_NAME$ who are searching in a $ROW$x$COL$ maze. Given their shared goal and information provided by them, please help me generate a short instruction to send to $AGENT_NAME$ to help it achieve the goal as soon as possible. Agents do not need to search for items together, they can search the maze individually.
Goal: $GOAL$
Dead ends: $DEAD_ENDS$
Position: $POSITIONS$
Observation: $OBSERVATIONS$
Progress: $PROGRESS$
Instruction history:
$INSTRUCTION_HISTORY$

Instruction to $AGENT_NAME$:

Note: The generated instruction should be accurate, helpful and brief. Do not generate repetitive instructions.
