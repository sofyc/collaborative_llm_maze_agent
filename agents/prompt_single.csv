base,"You are an expert in maze item search. I'm agent $AGENT_NAME$. I'm searching in a $ROW$x$COL$ maze. My visibility is limited to the surrounding four positions. Given my goal, my position, my observation, progress, my previous actions, available actions and helpful rules, please help me choose the best available action to achieve the goal as soon as possible.
Goal: $GOAL$
My position: $MY_POSITION$
My observation: $OBSERVATION$
Progress: $PROGRESS$
Previous actions: $ACTION_HISTORY$
Available actions:
$AVAILABLE_ACTIONS$
Here are some helpful rules to search the maze, I must examine these rules one by one when choosing actions:
1. Always pick up items in my current positions if possible to accumulate scores.
2. Never move to positions that lead to a dead end.
3. When I can move to multiple positions that don't lead to a dead end, do not repeat previous actions and do not move to positions that have been explored.

Note: Remember to include the letter option in answer."
