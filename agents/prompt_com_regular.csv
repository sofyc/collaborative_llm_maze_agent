Here are some helpful rules to search the maze, I must examine these rules one by one when choosing actions:
1. Always pick up items in my current positions if possible to accumulate scores.
2. Never move to positions that lead to a dead end.
3. When I can move to multiple positions that don't lead to a dead end, do not repeat previous actions and do not move to positions that have been explored.

Note: Remember to include the letter option in answer.
